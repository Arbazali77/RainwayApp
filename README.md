Rainway is a web-based game streaming platform that lets users play their favorite PC games on different devices so they can play anywhere. Using low latency, device-agnostic streaming technology games like; Fortnite, Overwatch, Call of Duty, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and much more can be played on smartphones, tablets, and macOS with.

In 2017 when I conceptualized Rainway, many believed that game streaming (now more commonly referred to as cloud gaming) was still out of reach from being realized by any company, let alone a startup. Fueled by a desire to move the game industry forward and full of ambitions for what the future of gaming could look like, we dove headfirst into the challenge. Now in 2022, we’ve all seen how COVID-19 changed the ways we work, learn, entertain ourselves, and collaborate.
